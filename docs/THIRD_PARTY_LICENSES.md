## Models

The installer includes jinen-v1-xsmall Q5_K_M and its tokenizer, from
[togatogah/jinen-v1-xsmall](https://huggingface.co/togatogah/jinen-v1-xsmall),
converted to GGUF by [togatogah](https://huggingface.co/togatogah/jinen-v1-xsmall.gguf).
These files are redistributed unmodified under [CC BY-SA 4.0](licenses/CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt).

AI-mode Qwen GGUF models and the separate llama-server are optional downloads,
not included in the installer. Their original licenses apply separately.

## Binary dependencies

The installer includes license files collected from the exact Cargo and NuGet
packages used to build the release, including llama.cpp and the .NET / Windows
App SDK notices, under `licenses/`. Mozc date conversion attribution is included
as `licenses/MOZC-DATE-LICENSE.txt`.
